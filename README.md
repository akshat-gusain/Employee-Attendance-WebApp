# Employee Attendance System

This repository contains the **Employee Attendance System**, a project designed with **Onion Architecture** for a clean and scalable design. The application is built with four layers: **Application**, **Core**, **Infrastructure**, and **WebUI**.

## üìã Project Overview

The **Employee Attendance System** is a robust and modular solution for managing employee attendance. It employs **Onion Architecture** to ensure high maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. This architecture divides the application into loosely coupled layers, making it easier to scale and adapt to future requirements.

## üèóÔ∏è Onion Architecture Layers

1. **Core Layer**  
   The core layer contains the domain logic and domain entities. It is the heart of the application and independent of other layers.
   - Domain Models
   - Interfaces for repositories and services

2. **Application Layer**  
   The application layer includes business logic, use cases, and application-specific services. It defines workflows and interacts with the core layer.
   - Application services
   - Use case handlers
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

3. **Infrastructure Layer**  
   The infrastructure layer implements repository interfaces and handles external concerns such as databases, file storage, and third-party integrations.
   - Database context and migrations
   - Repository implementations
   - External APIs and services

4. **WebUI Layer**  
   The WebUI layer is the entry point of the application, providing a user interface for interacting with the system.
   - Controllers
   - API endpoints
   - Front-end integration (if applicable)
